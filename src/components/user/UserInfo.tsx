      <p>When I graduated from college, life was going to be so different. I was going to be able to finally do what I wanted, go where I wanted and make my own decisions. It didn’t turn out that way. After three years of unsuccessful job interviews, freelance writing and odd jobs, I realized that the life I dreamed of didn’t exist for me. Instead of a brightly lit future with endless possibilities, my path led me through endless dead ends and no clear destination. So what went wrong?
